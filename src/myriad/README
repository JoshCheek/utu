This is the very minimum of the myriad library you need to build
the utuminimal library.  If all you want to do is use enough of 
Utu to then build a binding for your language, then don't install
myriad and you'll get a standalone libutuminimal.

This libutuminimal library only has the crypto and stackish processing
elements needed.
