h2. Why? ~_(could be fun)_~

I'm basically trying to create a technical solution to a social problem
started with another technical solution created by people who didn't understand
how their technical solutions create social problems because they believe
you can't create a technical solution to a social problem.

The Utu project is simultaneously an experiment in three things:

# An alternative simplified protocol design that counters the IETF and W3C dogma.
# An attempt to use technology to improve social interactions.
# An experiment in how technology changes the way people behave.

These are things that interest "me":http://www.zedshaw.com/ but hopefully
will inspire and help other people.  If anything, I hope it at least gets
people talking about the social impact of the technologies they create.
