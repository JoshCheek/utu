h2. Utu ~_(it means revenge)_~

The Internet needs more hate.  Much more.

We're overrun by morons, assholes, griefers, spammers, porn peddlers, Nazi
dictators, little Napoleons, and arbitrary censors who only behave in their
socially deficient manner because they know you can't do anything about it.

The Internet gives little people the power, confidence, and anonymity they
need to abuse anyone they want without any fear of retribution.

In the real world you would tell them to screw off personally.  You'd call the
police.  You'd move to the other side of the room and tell all your friends to
ignore them.  You'd punch them in the face for the things they said about you
and your family.  You'd never give anyone with that much acne control over
anything in your life.

Yet on the Internet you're forced to give these social predators control of
your communications.

_The Utu project will give you back the social controls you enjoy in real life._

Walking away from their tantrums.  Telling your friends about them.  Destroying
their reputation.  Throwing them out of your house.  Having them arrested to
serve long prison sentences.  All the things you do to remove unpleasant
annoying people from your life and the life of others.

Utu's goal is to improve the quality of communications on the Internet by
introducing cryptographic models of processes found in existing human social
interactions.

In short...
