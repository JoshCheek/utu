h2. Project ~_(getting code and stuff)_~

More formal project management information and technical specifications
will be available on "utuprotocol.info":http://utuprotocol.info which will
get a huge facelift in the near future.  For now it's ultra low-fi and
just intended to host the darcs repo and provide an RSS feed of changes.

h3. Utu Project

* "mailing list on google groups":http://groups.google.com/group/utuprotocol
* "repository":http://utuprotocol.info/repos/utu/
* "changes RSS feed":http://utuprotocol.info/repos/utu/changes.rss


h3. Myriad Project

You only need the Myriad code if you are trying to build the hub on *LINUX*.
All other uses (client, other OS, etc.) do *not* need Myriad.

* "repository":http://utuprotocol.info/repos/myriad/
* "changes RSS feed":http://utuprotocol.info/repos/myriad/changes.rss


h2. Submitting Patches

If you want to contribute, after following the "build instructions":/download.html
you'll need to install some additional tools:

* "darcs":http://darcs.net/
* "Ragel":http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/

All the source is freely accessible via darcs and there's full "build
instructions":/download.html you can follow to get things built on most
platforms.

I do *not* provide access to this machine by anyone else in order to maintain
the integrity of the source, but I do accept patches sent to me via
"darcs send":http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/manual/node7.html#SECTION00764000000000000000 and I'll review them and include them if they're good.

The process for getting the source and contributing your patches is:

# Install darcs for your system.
# Follow the "build instructions":/download.html
# Make your changes and write tests and documentation comments.
# run darcs send

That should be it.  If everything's working right it should send the
patch to me at "zedshaw at zedshaw.com":mailto:zedshaw-No-SPAM@zedshaw.com
and then I'll take a look.

As a general rule I do *not* accept patches from people I who have anonymous
or semi-anonymous vanity emails.  I'll need a way to verify you're a real
person so make sure you use an email address I can double check.  GPG keys
are nice too, but not necessary.

Of course as Utu gets more stable and useful it'll be used as the primary means
of identification and control for this process.
