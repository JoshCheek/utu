h2. Status ~_(are we there yet?)_~

The site is almost filled with all the important information.  The 
main missing piece of documentation is the protocol implementation.
I'll be getting that up pretty soon.

There's a working server with the initial features needed to
connect encrypted and identified as well as join rooms, find
out who's in the rooms, and list out the rooms.  This implements
enough features to do the majority of chat activities found on 
IRC.

You can access the server by going to myutu.name on port 10000.
The myutu.name DNS is an alias to the same server and will eventually
host a web interface to people's reputations and identities.  For
now it's a handy alias for savingtheinternetwithhate.com.

The "download instructions":/download.html currently describes how
to play with the "iHate":http://ihate.rubyforge.org/ client for Mac OSX
and how to build everything from scratch so you can run the simple
text clients and the Tk example client.

h2. Next Features -- 22 May 2007

I'm currently working on the following features:

* Getting information on people.
* Private messaging people.
* Unique names for everyone on the server.
* An idle ping managed by the mendicant to keep idle timeout killers away.

I'm hoping to have this feature set up for Mike to work into the client.
