h2. Credits ~_(the Utu story)_~

Utu is a pearl created by the irritants of the Internet.  

I needed people like
"dalvenjah":http://web.archive.org/web/20011221090705/www.dalnet.org/history/
running DALnet as motivation for replacing IRC.  I needed the griefers who
destroyed "Lambda Moo":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rape_in_Cyberspace to
make me considered the nature of "open" communities and the rule of law in
social interactions.  I needed the "slashdot
trolls":http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/3/30/22320/3779, mailing list
fanbois, "zombie botnets":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet, spammers, and
other "internet dust-bunnies":http://www.fudco.com/habitat/archives/000058.html
to inspire me to ask this one question:

  "Can technology find a balance between anarchy and dictatorship?"

I also have to thank the "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/ community for
simultaneously being both a great community and one run by a bunch of evil autistic
robots who should never be in charge of an IRC channel.  If it weren't for the
Nazi assholes booting me out of IRC in a rage of jealousy for the success of my
Ruby projects while they slaved away in obscurity I wouldn't have been
motivated to start Utu.  If it also weren't for the really great people who I
wanted to continue talking with in the Ruby community I might have just left
for another place to have fun.

The name Utu came from an article I read about an actor from New Zealand who
took on Amazon's one-click patent and actually found prior art enough to get
the patent office to review the patent.  He did this because Amazon took four
days to send him a book instead of three.  In the middle of the article he
says, "it was time for a bit of Utu."

Utu is the Maori word for a tribal system of justice that involved the near
trading of revenge and payment for deeds done by others.  The system keeps
everything balanced in Maori society by enforcing a controlled system of
retribution and favor between tribal members.  It was the perfect name for my
system.  It also is the name of the Sumerian Sun god who watches over the dead,
and it's a name for various systems of retribution in some parts of Africa.

Utu wouldn't exist without the Maori people also, or the man who took on Amazon
in a perfect display of how one really pissed off dude can make a difference.

There's plenty of people who've shot me ideas, encouragement, and tried out
initial releases as I worked on them.  Thanks goes out to all of you, even if I
don't name you directly.

Finally, to the "caboose fan club":http://blog.caboo.se/ for being the best
test users for just this kind of project.
